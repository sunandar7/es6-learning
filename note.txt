control flow => control the flow of code based on condition.
control flow => conditional statement, switch statement, loop.
conditional statement => if, else if, else.
switch statement => switch()
loop => for loop, while loop, do...while loop.

error handling => handling the exception error without stopping the code execution.
throw => if the exception error occurred, throw this exception.
The throw statement allows you to create custom errors and throw them when a particular condition is met or when an error condition occurs.
try...catch => The try block contains the code that may potentially throw an error.
If an error occurs within the try block, control is transferred to the catch block, where you can handle the error.
The error parameter in the catch block contains information about the error that occurred.

for of and for in => 
for of loop iterates over the values of an iterable object, such as an array or string.
for in loop => for in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.

loop and iteration =>loop - execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met.
iteration - refers to each execution of the loop's body.

Error handling in JavaScript ES6 involves the process of detecting, responding to, and managing errors that occur during the execution of a JavaScript program. It ensures that your code can gracefully handle unexpected situations and failures, preventing the program from crashing and providing a better user experience.
